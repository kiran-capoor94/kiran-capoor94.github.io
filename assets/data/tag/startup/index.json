Being a python &#x26; a web developer, I can build anything with my skill set. I just needed to find an opportunity.\nThe next question I had to ask myself was ‚Äì\nHow do I find the opportunity?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-opportunity\">The opportunity</h2>\n<p>What most indie developers like to do is think about their app first, what features to include, what‚Äôs the requirements, what is the time to production, etc.</p>\n<p>Being a businessman &#x26; a Dev, I thought first of the opportunity, it‚Äôs pros, it‚Äôs cons &#x26; lastly the market that I intend to target. As to me, customers come first then the app and then the monetary aspects.</p>\n<p>While searching for an opportunity, I stumbled upon <em>‚ÄòEmail Marketing‚Äô</em>. Email marketing for the most part has been driven by analytics, data, automation, and personalization. It‚Äôs one of the most underrated methods in Digital Marketing as it requires in-depth knowledge about your target audience than any other technique, but has the opportunity to become the largest conversion technique in the shortest amount of time.</p>\n<p>A great copy, a simple email sending tool, and knowledge about your targets are all you really need to succeed at Email Marketing.<br>\nTools like Mailchimp &#x26; Sendgrid provide with everything at an extravagant cost. Upon closer inspection using <strong>AWS‚Äôs Cost Estimates</strong> &#x26; bits of Excel data modeling.</p>\n<p>I found a few points ‚Äì</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Price to cost ratio</strong> was manageable for a small startup like mine.</li>\n<li>I can offer ‚Äòcore‚Äô features at a <strong>really low cost</strong> <em>~\\$10 for 10,000 to 50,000 emails</em>.</li>\n<li>A <strong>customer-centric approach</strong> is the best way forward.</li>\n<li>Automation will be built at a later stage as I will need data as to how much of that <em>solution is beneficial for my customers</em>.</li>\n<li>Drag and drop Templates are great to use but have issues with Email Clients.</li>\n<li>In the first release, <em>I will have to keep this solution aside until I find a complete answer to this problem</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-begin\">Where to begin?</h2>\n<p>This question puzzled me for the longest time. The answer was simple.</p>\n<p><strong>Design a Plan Of Action.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Will be continued in the next part. Thanks for reading</em> üòÅ</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
