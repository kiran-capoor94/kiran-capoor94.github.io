Designing, building, and implementing solutions is something that I have done since my teenage years.</p>\n<p><strong>Pokemon Go</strong> was a newly launched game by <strong>Google &#x26; Niantic</strong>, during my teenage years. We had to walk miles to catch a single imaginary/virtual Pok√©mon, collect items, etc. Being the lazy person that I was, to avoid walking to the United States to catch a rare Pok√©mon, I developed a simple hack using Python. This hack allowed my in-game character to walk a thousand miles a day and catch all the Pok√©mon, from the comfort of my bedroom.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My passion for technology stems from the concept on which Python is built - ‚Äú<em>Simple is better</em>‚Äù.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My team and I assisted Intelak, an Emirates company, in redesigning and implementing a B2B focused User interface with a fluid and rich User experience. We have assisted Amazingworkplaces, an initiative by BrandRecall, during the early days of launch with their marketing and web-based platform.</p>\n<p>For many years now, we have designed and implemented solutions ranging from a simple Website to High Complexity Systems like a CRM, and E-commerce Web App built complete IT ecosystems on AWS, Heroku, etc.</p>\n<p>Currently, we are working to bring an Email Marketing tool into the market. A simple tool to help assist in your daily needs of email marketing, lead generation, customer engagement, and much more all under a simple and easy to use Interface.</p>\n<p><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://texmith.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Texmith</a></strong></p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Journey to building a SaaS Product‚Äì#1","path":"/journey-to-building-a-saa-s-product-1/","date":"17.

Being a python &#x26; a web developer, I can build anything with my skill set. I just needed to find an opportunity.\nThe next question I had to ask myself was ‚Äì\nHow do I find the opportunity?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-opportunity\">The opportunity</h2>\n<p>What most indie developers like to do is think about their app first, what features to include, what‚Äôs the requirements, what is the time to production, etc.</p>\n<p>Being a businessman &#x26; a Dev, I thought first of the opportunity, it‚Äôs pros, it‚Äôs cons &#x26; lastly the market that I intend to target. As to me, customers come first then the app and then the monetary aspects.</p>\n<p>While searching for an opportunity, I stumbled upon <em>‚ÄòEmail Marketing‚Äô</em>. Email marketing for the most part has been driven by analytics, data, automation, and personalization. It‚Äôs one of the most underrated methods in Digital Marketing as it requires in-depth knowledge about your target audience than any other technique, but has the opportunity to become the largest conversion technique in the shortest amount of time.</p>\n<p>A great copy, a simple email sending tool, and knowledge about your targets are all you really need to succeed at Email Marketing.<br>\nTools like Mailchimp &#x26; Sendgrid provide with everything at an extravagant cost. Upon closer inspection using <strong>AWS‚Äôs Cost Estimates</strong> &#x26; bits of Excel data modeling.</p>\n<p>I found a few points ‚Äì</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Price to cost ratio</strong> was manageable for a small startup like mine.</li>\n<li>I can offer ‚Äòcore‚Äô features at a <strong>really low cost</strong> <em>~\\$10 for 10,000 to 50,000 emails</em>.</li>\n<li>A <strong>customer-centric approach</strong> is the best way forward.</li>\n<li>Automation will be built at a later stage as I will need data as to how much of that <em>solution is beneficial for my customers</em>.</li>\n<li>Drag and drop Templates are great to use but have issues with Email Clients.</li>\n<li>In the first release, <em>I will have to keep this solution aside until I find a complete answer to this problem</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-begin\">Where to begin?</h2>\n<p>This question puzzled me for the longest time. The answer was simple.</p>\n<p><strong>Design a Plan Of Action.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Will be continued in the next part. Thanks for reading</em> üòÅ</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
