Being a python &#x26; a web developer, I can build anything with my skill set. I just needed to find an opportunity.\nThe next question I had to ask myself was ‚Äì\nHow do I find the opportunity?</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-opportunity\">The opportunity</h2>\n<p>What most indie developers like to do is think about their app first, what features to include, what‚Äôs the requirements, what is the time to production, etc.</p>\n<p>Being a businessman &#x26; a Dev, I thought first of the opportunity, it‚Äôs pros, it‚Äôs cons &#x26; lastly the market that I intend to target. As to me, customers come first then the app and then the monetary aspects.</p>\n<p>While searching for an opportunity, I stumbled upon <em>‚ÄòEmail Marketing‚Äô</em>. Email marketing for the most part has been driven by analytics, data, automation, and personalization. It‚Äôs one of the most underrated methods in Digital Marketing as it requires in-depth knowledge about your target audience than any other technique, but has the opportunity to become the largest conversion technique in the shortest amount of time.</p>\n<p>A great copy, a simple email sending tool, and knowledge about your targets are all you really need to succeed at Email Marketing.<br>\nTools like Mailchimp &#x26; Sendgrid provide with everything at an extravagant cost. Upon closer inspection using <strong>AWS‚Äôs Cost Estimates</strong> &#x26; bits of Excel data modeling.</p>\n<p>I found a few points ‚Äì</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Price to cost ratio</strong> was manageable for a small startup like mine.</li>\n<li>I can offer ‚Äòcore‚Äô features at a <strong>really low cost</strong> <em>~\\$10 for 10,000 to 50,000 emails</em>.</li>\n<li>A <strong>customer-centric approach</strong> is the best way forward.</li>\n<li>Automation will be built at a later stage as I will need data as to how much of that <em>solution is beneficial for my customers</em>.</li>\n<li>Drag and drop Templates are great to use but have issues with Email Clients.</li>\n<li>In the first release, <em>I will have to keep this solution aside until I find a complete answer to this problem</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"where-to-begin\">Where to begin?</h2>\n<p>This question puzzled me for the longest time. The answer was simple.</p>\n<p><strong>Design a Plan Of Action.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Will be continued in the next part. Thanks for reading</em> üòÅ</p>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/alexandr-podvalny-220262-unsplash.07cc2b7.490343832c4705701e26598c1c374606.jpg","size":{"width":860,"height":573},"sizes":"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px","srcset":["/assets/static/alexandr-podvalny-220262-unsplash.a67b0b2.490343832c4705701e26598c1c374606.jpg 480w","/assets/static/alexandr-podvalny-220262-unsplash.07cc2b7.490343832c4705701e26598c1c374606.jpg 860w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 860 573' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-18076a59077cb1687acc04e4f9a1f92c'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='10'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-18076a59077cb1687acc04e4f9a1f92c)' width='860' height='573' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAArAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAQQDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwECAwUABAYI/8QAMRAAAQMCAwcCAwkAAAAAAAAAAQACAwQRBQYhEhMiMUGRoVFhcYGxFiMyQkNScsHh/8QAGQEAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEAAMF/8QAJhEAAgEDAgQHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQSESETQVGRIiQxQlKBof/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A8%2bmMkpzYXHorWOjLjyW/T4YXW0KqaRItSgbTOPRTNpHHoV1lNgrnW4T2VpTZdc63D4W8PNhxm/RHCNoXH8pUzMPeehRKp8qvcBZnhWVPk57v0/CZSh1ElTqdAYUuHuBHCVZQ0LjbQonQZLfp90ey2m5SMYuYz2XaNenHmTTo1HyBPEZIBeWnpx6XlsrWnnqmxtdHh0JvyO2dVxMON1EJvC4Md%2b5rRfusnxqsmFqipneD0dIforXC3%2bJGp3i9wQY8VxGIgihpAPc/6p34/i7C1zm01O1pvpZo%2bd0Oo8bkihMdM1sV/wAT%2bb3fM8h7BNmxmqqGbNRO6VtrWfZ31RwtlvgK6l89nUCzhOe8Qjm3b2YTVG%2bjNrZd4K6Nudsba3gwKiab8yXnTuvPrqtr28YGnL1U9Pibo5WubUVMY5bTH6/UJHRtm9XBfozq3qWiqPsmGzMGdMxV9KKemp4MNF7vfATtu9rk6D4KpGb83U%2byXVW9jAsRJC11x8bf2ht9oamO26xOsH89beVDUZsxLVorpJPe2nldMLWMccFp3J/PSnlxN/tHKia3UpTKSbk%2bVrhLfVQZM9rBE4kI6jus3x9QoeqcOi2rNih5ld6rN4fUppAHJKOQW3BohdspCT1KaSVGSUGwqJ//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},"context":{}}
