Designing, building, and implementing solutions is something that I have done since my teenage years.</p>\n<p><strong>Pokemon Go</strong> was a newly launched game by <strong>Google &#x26; Niantic</strong>, during my teenage years. We had to walk miles to catch a single imaginary/virtual Pokémon, collect items, etc. Being the lazy person that I was, to avoid walking to the United States to catch a rare Pokémon, I developed a simple hack using Python. This hack allowed my in-game character to walk a thousand miles a day and catch all the Pokémon, from the comfort of my bedroom.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My passion for technology stems from the concept on which Python is built - “<em>Simple is better</em>”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My team and I assisted Intelak, an Emirates company, in redesigning and implementing a B2B focused User interface with a fluid and rich User experience. We have assisted Amazingworkplaces, an initiative by BrandRecall, during the early days of launch with their marketing and web-based platform.</p>\n<p>For many years now, we have designed and implemented solutions ranging from a simple Website to High Complexity Systems like a CRM, and E-commerce Web App built complete IT ecosystems on AWS, Heroku, etc.</p>\n<p>Currently, we are working to bring an Email Marketing tool into the market. A simple tool to help assist in your daily needs of email marketing, lead generation, customer engagement, and much more all under a simple and easy to use Interface.</p>\n<p><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://texmith.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Texmith</a></strong></p>\n","cover_image":null}},"context":{}}
