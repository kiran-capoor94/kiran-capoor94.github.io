**Founder, developer, and innovator at [Texmith](https://texmith.com).**

Python and technology are my passion. Designing, building, and implementing solutions is something that I have done since my teenage years.

**Pokemon Go** was a newly launched game by **Google & Niantic**, during my teenage years. We had to walk miles to catch a single imaginary/virtual Pokémon, collect items, etc. Being the lazy person that I was, to avoid walking to the United States to catch a rare Pokémon, I developed a simple hack using Python. This hack allowed my in-game character to walk a thousand miles a day and catch all the Pokémon, from the comfort of my bedroom.

> My passion for technology stems from the concept on which Python is built - “_Simple is better_”.

My team and I assisted Intelak, an Emirates company, in redesigning and implementing a B2B focused User interface with a fluid and rich User experience. We have assisted Amazingworkplaces, an initiative by BrandRecall, during the early days of launch with their marketing and web-based platform.

For many years now, we have designed and implemented solutions ranging from a simple Website to High Complexity Systems like a CRM, and E-commerce Web App built complete IT ecosystems on AWS, Heroku, etc.

Currently, we are working to bring an Email Marketing tool into the market. A simple tool to help assist in your daily needs of email marketing, lead generation, customer engagement, and much more all under a simple and easy to use Interface.
